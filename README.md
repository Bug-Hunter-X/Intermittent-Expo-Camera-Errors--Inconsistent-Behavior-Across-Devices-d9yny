# Intermittent Expo Camera Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet elusive, bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API. The issue involves inconsistent errors occurring across various devices, making debugging a significant challenge.

The `cameraBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `cameraBugSolution.js` provides a robust solution to mitigate the problem.

**Problem:**

The error is sporadic, often appearing only on certain devices or under specific usage patterns. The console logs may not provide clear guidance on the cause, leading to significant development time being spent troubleshooting.

**Solution:**

The solution implements improved error handling and ensures that camera functions are only called after a confirmation that the camera is fully initialized and ready.
